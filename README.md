# ElectricFieldAnalysis

.f90 file is based on the 1/r2 scaling method to calculate the middle of the specific chemical bond. It generates the results of both EField vector and the projected EField onto 
each chemical bond, e.g. Au-C1, Au-C2 and C1-C2

.sh file is based on the vdW radii method for each bonded atoms.
